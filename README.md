# Brain Media Solutions Assignment

This is a responsive landing page for Brains Media Solutions that includes the following
sections: Menu Bar, Slider, Services, About Us, Mission, Vision, and Footer. The landing page should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
In this assignment I used some dummy text for the content.



## Project Overview

**Key Features:**

1. **Menu Bar:** Design a clean and intuitive navigation menu. Included links to the different sections of the landing page. Ensured about proper functionality and responsiveness.

2. **Slider:** Created a component (section) that introduces Brains Media Solutions, also included the navigation buttons and indicators for users to move through the slider.
3. **About Us:** Creates a section that introduces Brains Media Solutions. Used visually appealing elements to capture the user's attention and CTA. Created 3 cards in which " Our Mission, Our Vision and Our Values " are introduced.

4. **Services:** Created a section that showcases the services offered by Brains Media Solutions. Present each service with a brief description and a relevant icon. Included a call-to-action (CTA) button for users to learn more about each service.

## Note: 
I have not created each sections page, like in "services" section , I created button "Learn More" with all the service , but not created page for each service, I only attached "dummy link" which will not redirect to any other page, but you can see on page url that the url changes when you click on "Learn More" button.
